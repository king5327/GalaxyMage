    <h1>Changelog</h1>

    <h2>Version 0.4.0</h2>

    <h3>Changes</h3>
    Joystick support temporarily disabled.

    <h2>Version 0.3.0</h2>
    Nobody bothered to update this before I got ahold of the code.

    <h2>Version 0.2.0</h2>

    <h3>Content</h3>

    The "adept", "squire", and "scout" classes have been replaced with six
    new classes that will be considered our core classes: "fighter",
    "defender", "rogue", "archer", "healer", and "mage". Stats of all
    these classes have been tweaked. A few new abilities have been added
    for the new classes.
    <p>
      A random map generator and random scenario generator have been added.
    <p>
      New "win" and "loss" music.

      <h3>Battle Engine</h3>

      Units can now wear weapons and armor. Some basic weapons and armor
      have been added to the data/core/items directory. The sounds played
      when attacking with a weapon now depend on the type of weapon (so bows
      make an arrow noise, swords make a clangy noise, and so on.)
    <p>
      Ranged attacks can now be targeted up to 16 height-units up/down from
      the unit's position. (The previous value was 8.)

      <h3>User Interface</h3>

      Scenarios can now be chosen from the GUI instead of only from the
      command-line. After a battle is complete, GalaxyMage returns to the
      GUI scenario chooser so that the player can pick another scenario to
      play.
    <p>
      You can now cancel a unit's move if it has not yet acted. (Just press
      the escape key until the unit returns to its old position.)
    <p>
      Preliminary joystick support added.
    <p>
      The camera behavior is now a bit better on maps with significant
      height differences (units stay centered without the need to zoom in
      and out).
    <p>
      The camera can now be rotated smoothly by right-clicking and draggins
      left/right.
    <p>
      The highlights showing unit movement ranges have been changed from
      green to cyan. This makes it a bit easier to see the movement ranges
      on green grassy areas.
    <p>
      We now use linear filtering to smooth unit sprites when they are
      viewed close-up.
    <p>
      Fix for a bug where the camera would oscillate wildly for players with
      very low FPS.

      <h3>AI</h3>

      The AI has been improved significantly. It actually makes use of
      special attacks, healing, and so on. It's currently a bit unoptimized,
      so might take a bit of time in some circumstances. The AI now runs in
      a separate thread. The battle engine is currently responsible for
      displaying the actions taken by the AI. Previous scenarios have been
      rebalanced to account for the stronger AI.

      <h3>Translation</h3>

      Infrastructure for translation has been added. A translation of
      GalaxyMage into French is underway.

      <h2>Version 0.1.2</h2>

      <h3>Content</h3>

      Added a new map and a scenario for that map. The map includes a
      hill, ravine, and river.

      <h3>Battle Engine</h3>

      Dead units now disappear from the battlefield.

      <h3>User Interface</h3>

      The main window is now resizable.
    <p>
      After an action is complete, the camera focus remains on the unit for
      a short period of time, to ensure that the player can see the effects
      of the action.
    <p>
      Added keybinding: Home/End now rotate the map (in addition to
      brackets), for users who do not have bracket keys on their keyboards.
    <p>
      Added mouse binding: the map can also be rotated by right-clicking and
      dragging to the left or right.
    <p>
      Added keybinding: hit F12 to toggle fullscreen during
      play. Unfortunately, this only works in Linux.
    <p>
      If a scenario isn't specified on the command-line, the scenario will
      be chosen randomly.

      <h3>Design Tools</h3>

      Implemented a preliminary tool to make map-building easier.
    <p>
      Scenario designers can now set the sky color of their scenarios. If
      left unset, it defaults to the fog color; if the fog color is also
      unset, it defaults to a dark blue.

      <h3>Documentation</h3>

      Added a lot more documentation for designers: an overview of all the
      components of a GalaxyMage campaign, basic config file format
      information, and a detailed tutorial on creating maps by hand.

      <h3>Miscellaneous</h3>

      New "GM" icon.
    <p>
      Started using Python's built-in logging module. The old "-d"
      command-line option has been replaced by "-v". A lot more system
      information is now logged to the debug steam.
    <p>
      Fixed some graphics issues -- surface normals for the tops of map
      squares now seem to be working properly for squares with non-zero
      corner heights. Some mild performance improvements.

      <h2>Version 0.1.1</h2>

      Bug fix for crash that occurs on machines without sound cards
      (pygame.mixer unable to initialize).

      <h2>Version 0.1.0</h2>

      Initial release.
